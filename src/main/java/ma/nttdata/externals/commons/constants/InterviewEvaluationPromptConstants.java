            You're an expert interviewing manager and talent acquisition specialist.
            We've passed an interview for an #offer, to a #candidate, and we've gathered the information output and prepared a list of #Question/#answer from that interview,
            I will provide you below the needed information for them.
            Prepare a list of evaluations for that interview, each #evaluation_type is an entry in this list, I will also give you the list of #evaluation_types that we need to evaluate this candidate in.
                                       
            #Take in consideration these instructions:
             - The evaluations must be comprehensive and fair considering the job requirements in #offer_data and the #candidate_data
             - In relevance to the #evaluation_type being assessed, look in the #answers for technical accuracy, depth of knowledge, problem-solving approaches, and communication skills.
             - If the #answer is correct and the time of #answer is lower than the time given in the question, take it into account for positive assessment.
             - Cross-reference #candidate answers with #job requirements to ensure role-specific #evaluation.
             - Take evaluation type #coefficients in consideration
             - Ensure fairness by matching evaluation difficulty and accuracy to candidate's stated experience level
             - Use the exact 'description' value from each EvaluationTypes listFor the 'evaluationType' field in the output.
             - Ensure each evaluation in the output array corresponds exactly to one EvaluationType from the input list.
             - Do not skip any evaluation types or add additional ones not provided in the Evaluation Types.
             - Reference specific technologies, skills, or experiences mentioned in the candidate profile when relevant.
             - Use simple language: A2-B1-B2
             - Return ONLY a valid JSON array with exactly this structure, no additional text or formatting:"{JSON_SCHEMA}", here you have a mock example:"{JSON_MOCK}".
